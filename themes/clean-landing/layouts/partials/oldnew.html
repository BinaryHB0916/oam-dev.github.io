            <h3>Traditional Way</h3>
            <h2 class="is-2">App Deployment is Hard</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Developers spend time on infrastructure details instead of apps - ingress, labels, DNS, etc, and learning how the infrastructure is implemented.</li>
              <li>Restricted deployment platform with inextensible APIs, makes it certain that the needs of your app will outgrow your platform capabilities.</li>
              <li>Runtime lock-in - app description is tightly coupled with execution runtime, which heavily impact on how you configure, develop and operate the app across hybrid environments.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>The OAM Way</h3>
            <h2 class="is-2">An <em>App-centric</em> Approach</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Application first - define the app with a self-contained model, where operational behaviors as part of app definition, free of infrastructure here.</li>
              <li>Clarity and extensibility - an open standard to modularize deployment system's capabilities into reusable pieces, with full flexibility to adapt to your deployment needs.</li>
              <li>Runtime agnostic - a consistent experience to deploy and operate your apps across on-prem clusters, cloud providers or even edge devices.</li>
